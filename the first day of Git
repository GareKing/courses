scanning the codes to find a error is accessible but is a waste of time, that is why built in tools are needed to compare files;
windows has FC and Mac and linux has Diff
Git Bash can complete the exercise
there is one more thing about using cmd to locate a folder/1. cd 2.cd c:/folder 3. c:/folder>files name
FC is not a default tool actually, because my computer cannot start up FC
